# nft-marketplace-starter-kit
I have successfully finished my first NFT marketplace development and implementation from A-Z in terms of:
1. Building the smart contract ERC71 principles and functions.

2. Migrating the smart contracts to Ganache Eth development environment.

3. Integrating the Contract with Metamask wallet.

4. Integrating the Smart contract (backend) with React.js framework to demonstrate and reflect all functionalities.

**Please ensure you have downloaded the following additionally **

1. Ganache
2. Truffle (global installation)
3. Metamask.io (hooked up on the browser)

**To run the development server on a local host scripts:** npm run start

Good luck and have fun!
